\section{TelcoGAN Model}
In this section, we introduce our TelcoGAN model for Telco missing data completion. The descriptions are separated into four parts. First, we describe the design of TelcoGAN model as well as the interaction of different components. Second, we give the detailed feature extraction of MR data and explore the real-world relationship between connected cells and RSSI. Next, the designs of generator, discriminator and localizer is introduced respectively. Finally, we give TelcoGAN's optimization process.
