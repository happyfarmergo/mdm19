Telco localization, as an important complementary technique of GPS, is aimed at recovering mobility patterns of mobile devices (MDs) via the measurement report (MR) data generated in Telco networks. However, some RF signal strength (RSSI) values of MR records are commonly missing due to various reasons. As a result, MR data are often incomplete, raising the missing data completion problem for MR. To address the problem, we propose a deep learning solution, called TelcoGAN, by adapting the well-known Generative Adversarial Nets. To learn the internal correlation of MR data, we describe a serving-centric space for pre-processing. The TelcoGAN consists of three components: (\emph{i}) a localizer for predicting locations of input MR data; (\emph{ii}) a generator for generating complete MR data based on input missing MR data; and (\emph{iii}) a discriminator to learn the data distribution between real samples and completed samples from the generator. The generator tries to generate completed MR data that can fool the discriminator. The localizer exploits available position labels to stabilize the adversarial training process and guide the optimization of TelcoGAN. Experiments on two real-world MR data sets demonstrate the improvements of TelcoGAN in RMSE and localization error, compared with state-of-the-art baselines.
